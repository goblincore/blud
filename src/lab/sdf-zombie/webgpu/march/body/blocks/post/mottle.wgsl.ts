// Task-3 split of the march body (2026-09-19): colour mottle (post-hit material).
// MOVE-ONLY: spliced back into its parent string by interpolation, so the
// joined WGSL is byte-identical. See docs/dev-notes/2026-09-18-march-split/.

export const MOTTLE_BLOCK = /* wgsl */ `  // Colour mottle. surfaceNoiseAmp above perturbs the NORMAL, which reads as
  // texture but never as colour — under a broad key the whole creature stays
  // one hue and the silhouette reads as a single object. This is the albedo
  // twin, and it is what stops every .blob character being the same flat
  // sheet of flesh.
  //
  // Sampled off anchor, the REST-space point, exactly like the micro-detail
  // and the gore mottle: blotches then ride a limb through gait instead of
  // swimming across the surface as the body moves. A world-space sample looks
  // fine on a statue and wrong the moment anything walks.
  //
  // Before the wound/gore/face passes, so damage and the face still paint over
  // it — mottle is the flesh's own colour, not a layer on top. Amplitude-
  // guarded like every other quality lever here (see the LOD NOTE above), so a
  // preset that leaves mottleAmp at 0 skips the fbm entirely and shades
  // bit-for-bit as it did before this existed.

    // fbm here is two octaves of trilinear value noise summed at 0.6/0.3, and
    // like any such sum it concentrates hard around zero — the tails near
    // +/-0.9 are rare. Rescaling the nominal -1..1 range linearly therefore
    // lands almost every pixel near 0.5, which is not mottling at all: it is a
    // uniform half-strength tint toward mottleColor, so the body just goes
    // flatly darker and the amplitude reads as a brightness knob. That is
    // exactly what the first version did on screen.
    //
    // Mapping the range the noise ACTUALLY occupies to the full 0..1 is what
    // produces patches with light flesh between them. The bounds are the
    // working range, not the theoretical one.
    //
    // Note the frequency: fbm multiplies its own input by 4 and 9, so
    // mottleScale is roughly a quarter of the resulting cycles per metre. A
    // scale near 1 gives patches a hand-span across on a human-sized body;
    // by 5 it is already freckles, and past ~10 it aliases into what looks
    // like compression noise rather than skin.
